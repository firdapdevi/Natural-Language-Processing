Spelling Error Detection 

The string distance is a metric of how alike two strings are to each other. 
There are various ways of applying such an algorithm to the spelling error correction problem. 
The candidate word which is ‘closest’ to the error in the sense of having the highest probability given the error, is chosen. 
Hereby is build a probabilistic model for detecting of spelling errors with technique of bigram, trigram, and minimum edit distance. 
It shall correct spelling errors which result in non-words and real-words

1. Copy the content from these website articles and stored in Original_file.txt. 
2. Run program dictionary_creation.py to create the dictionary.txt, dictionary_real.txt, Zoology1.txt and Zoology2.txt. 
3, Put them in the sample folder, run the dictionary_creation.py first, then run the main.py
